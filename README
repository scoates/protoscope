Protoscope is an HTTP proxy for inspecting and debugging HTTP-related issues.

To start the proxy:

php protoscope.php

Configure your browser of choice to use an HTTP proxy. By default, Protoscope
binds to 127.0.0.1 on port 4887.

Browse the Web, and your HTTP requests are shown to you at the bottom of each
page. This is useful for debugging a number of issues, including session
problems, caching problems, etc. To see all HTTP traffic, check the log, which
is located at /tmp/protoscope.log by default. Tailing this log is useful:

tail -f /tmp/protoscope.log

This is a work in progress. If you don't know what you're doing, you probably
don't want to use it.
